## ✅ Conclusion

In this project, a Logistic Regression model was developed to predict loan approval decisions based on a range of applicant information, including credit history, employment status, income, and loan amount.

Key Highlights:

- Data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies

- Categorical variables were encoded for machine learning compatibility

- A classification model was built and evaluated for prediction accuracy

- Insights from the model can assist banks and financial institutions in automating loan decision workflows
